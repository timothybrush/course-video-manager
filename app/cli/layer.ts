 * READ-ONLY layer for the `cvm` CLI. Mirrors app/services/layer.server.ts but

 *
 * Write/publish services (CourseRepoWriteService, CoursePublishService,
 * CourseRepoParserService, CourseWriteService, ...) are intentionally OUT OF
 * SCOPE — the CLI is read-only by construction.
 *
 * The 8 services here cover all 10 nouns:
 *   course        -> CourseOperationsService
 *   version       -> VersionOperationsService
 *   section       -> LessonSectionOperationsService
 *   lesson        -> LessonSectionOperationsService
 *   video         -> VideoOperationsService
 *   clip          -> ClipOperationsService
 *   segment       -> SegmentOperationsService
 *   pitch         -> PitchOperationsService
 *   deliverable   -> DeliverableOperationsService
 *
 * NOTE: CliOutput is NOT in this layer. It is provided per-run at the program
 * edge so tests can swap in a captured implementation (see ./output.ts and
 * ./main.ts).
