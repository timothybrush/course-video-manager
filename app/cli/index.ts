/**

 */
const ROOT_HELP = `cvm — agent-facing access to this Course Video Manager project's domain data.

Read-mostly: every noun is READ-ONLY except 'segment', which is the first
write-capable noun (segment add/update/move/delete author a Video's Segment
plan). More nouns may gain writes over time; each verb's own --help is
authoritative about whether it reads or writes.

DOMAIN MODEL
  A Course is the primary entity. Its structure is snapshotted into Course
  Versions: a Draft Version (latest, editable) and zero or more Published
  Versions (frozen at Publish). Version-scoped reads default to the Draft.
  A Version contains Sections (directory-backed groupings), each containing
  Lessons. A Lesson contains Videos; a Video is an ordered sequence of Clips
  (recorded timeline) and is planned as an ordered sequence of Segments
  (intended structure, by job/kind). Pitches are course ideas with a derived
  Pitch State. Deliverables are calendar entries linking Courses and/or Pitches.

ADDRESSING (output is for agents)
  All 'get' arguments are IDs only. 'list' output is identity-rich (id, name/
  title, slug/path, parent ids) so you can map a name to an id in one call.
  Typical workflow: 'cvm <noun> list' to find an id, then 'cvm <noun> get <id>',
  or 'cvm <noun> tree <id>' then pipe to jq to drill in.

VERSIONS
  Version-scoped reads (course / section / lesson / tree) default to the Draft
  Version. Pass --course-version <id> to pin a Published Version snapshot.

ARCHIVED
  'list' shows ACTIVE records only. Only 'course' and standalone 'video' have a
  viewable archive (use --archived to include it). For every other noun,
  archived means deleted and is never shown.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
  Raw JSON, no envelope. 'get' of one id => one JSON object. 'list' and multi-id
  'get' => NDJSON (one compact object per line). Empty list => no output, exit 0.
  Errors => a JSON object on STDERR carrying the Effect error _tag. STDOUT is
  always pure data. Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 not-found, 3 invalid-input, 4 db/internal.

WRITES ('segment' only)
  'segment add/update/move/delete' author a Video's Segment plan. Writes hit the
  database immediately — no confirmation prompt, no dry-run. Each write echoes
  the affected row (delete echoes the archived row). Flags come BEFORE the
  positional <id> (a flag after it exits 3). See 'cvm segment --help'.
