## Documents

Here is the existing README content that needs to be refined:

<existing-readme>
${readmeFile.content}
</existing-readme>

${transcriptSection}${courseStructureSection}Here is the code for the video (for reference):

<code>
${opts.code
  .filter((file) => !file.path.toLowerCase().endsWith("readme.md"))
  .map((file) => `<file path="${file.path}">${file.content}</file>`)
  .join("\n")}
</code>

Here is a sample of what a well-formatted skill building README looks like:

${getSkillBuildingSharedTemplate(opts.images)}

<the-ask>
Refine the existing README to match our style guide and formatting standards. Apply all the rules above, ensuring:

1. Paragraphs are short (max 240 characters)
2. Code elements use backticks
3. Code samples are used effectively
4. Steps to complete follow the checkbox format
5. TODO comments are shown in full
6. Grammar is correct (e.g., "going to" instead of "gonna")
7. Lists, code samples, and tables are used to break up text

Output the COMPLETE refined README - do not output just the changes.

${getLinkInstructions(opts.links)}
</the-ask>

<output-format>
Do not enter into conversation with the user. Always assume that their messages to you are instructions for editing the content.

Respond only with the refined README content. Do not include any other text or explanations.
