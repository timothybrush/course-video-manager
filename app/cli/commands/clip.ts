/**
 * clip — a timestamped slice of source footage inside a Video.
 *
 * DOMAIN (see CONTEXT.md "Video and clips"):
 *   A Clip is one captured segment of source footage living on a Video's
 *   recorded timeline. It is defined by a source filename
 *   (`videoFilename`) and an in/out window into that file
 *   (`sourceStartTime`/`sourceEndTime`, in seconds). Clips and Chapters share
 *   a single fractional `order` space (varchar collate-C keys) — interleaving
 *   them in timeline order is exactly what produces the Video's Transcript.
 *   A Clip's `text` is the spoken transcription, populated from its audio
 *   (Transcription) and timestamped by `transcribedAt`. An "Effect Clip" is a
 *   special clip for non-speech content (white noise, transitions) inserted by
 *   hand; `beatType` carries that classification (default "none").
 *
 *   Clips are CHILDREN of a Video, addressed only by id. There is no version
 *   scoping here — clips belong to the live recorded timeline of one Video.
 *   Archived clips are treated as deleted: they are ALWAYS filtered out and
 *   never surfaced (no --archived flag on this noun).
 *
 * OUTPUT FIELDS:
 *   id               clip id (use with `clip get`)
 *   videoId          parent Video id
 *   videoFilename    source footage file this clip is cut from
 *   sourceStartTime  in-point into the source file, seconds (float)
 *   sourceEndTime    out-point into the source file, seconds (float)
 *   order            fractional-index sort key (shared with Chapters)
 *   text             spoken transcription of the clip (the Transcript unit)
 *   transcribedAt    when `text` was last produced (null = not transcribed)
 *   scene / profile  optional capture metadata
 *   beatType         clip classification; "none" for an ordinary clip
 *   diagramSnapshotId pinned DiagramSnapshot filmed against this clip, if any
 *   archived         always false in CLI output (archived rows are hidden)
 *   createdAt        row creation timestamp
 *
 * VERBS:
 *   clip list --video <videoId>   every active clip on a Video, timeline order
 *   clip get <id...>              one or more clips by id (variadic)
 *
 * Clips are leaf timeline rows — there is no `clip tree`. To explore a Video's
 * structure use `video tree`, then resolve ids with `clip get`.
 *
 * EXAMPLES:
 *   # All clips on a video, in timeline order (NDJSON):
 *   cvm clip list --video vid_123
 *
 *   # Just the transcript text of each clip:
 *   cvm clip list --video vid_123 | jq -r '.text'
 *
 *   # Find untranscribed clips:
 *   cvm clip list --video vid_123 | jq 'select(.transcribedAt == null) | .id'
 *
 *   # tree -> get workflow: pull clip ids off a video skeleton, then fetch them:
 *   cvm video tree --depth all vid_123 \
 *     | jq -r '.. | objects | select(.kind=="clip") | .id' \
 *     | xargs cvm clip get

const CLIP_HELP = `clip — a timestamped slice of source footage on a Video's recorded timeline.

A Clip is one captured segment of source footage, defined by a source filename and an in/out
window into it (sourceStartTime/sourceEndTime, seconds). Clips and Chapters share one fractional
'order' space; interleaving them in order is what forms the Video's Transcript. A clip's 'text' is
its spoken transcription. Clips are children of a Video, addressed by id only; there is no version
scoping and archived clips are always hidden (no --archived flag).

Verbs:
  clip list --video <videoId>   every active clip on a Video, in timeline order (NDJSON)
  clip get <id...>              fetch one or more clips by id (variadic)

There is no 'clip tree' (clips are leaves) — use 'video tree' then 'clip get'.`;

const LIST_HELP = `List every active (non-archived) Clip on a Video, in timeline order.

Requires --video <videoId>: the parent Video whose clips to source. Derived from the Video's
clip set (getVideoWithClipsById), already ordered by the shared clip/chapter 'order' key, so the
output reflects the recorded timeline. Output is NDJSON — one compact clip object per line; an
empty video prints nothing and exits 0. An unknown video id is a not-found error (exit 2).

Each line is identity-rich (id, videoId, order, text) so an agent can map content to ids in one
call, then drill in with 'clip get'.

Examples:
  cvm clip list --video vid_123
  cvm clip list --video vid_123 | jq -r '.text'
  cvm clip list --video vid_123 | jq 'select(.transcribedAt==null) | .id'`;

const GET_HELP = `Fetch one or more Clips by id. Variadic: 'clip get <id> [<id> ...]'.

Backed by the native multi-id getter (getClipsByIds), so many ids resolve in a single query.

Output contract:
  - one id, found     -> a single pretty-printed JSON object (exit 0)
  - one id, missing   -> NotFoundError on stderr, exit 2
  - many ids          -> NDJSON of the FOUND clips on stdout; if any id is missing, those ids are
                         reported on stderr and the process exits 2 (stdout stays pure data)

Args are ids ONLY (never names/paths). Find ids first with 'clip list --video <id>' or 'video tree'.

Examples:
  cvm clip get clip_abc
  cvm clip get clip_abc clip_def clip_ghi
  cvm clip get clip_abc | jq '{id, text, start: .sourceStartTime, end: .sourceEndTime}'`;
