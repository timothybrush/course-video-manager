 */
const ROOT_HELP = `cvm — agent-facing access to this Course Video Manager project's domain data.

Read-mostly: most verbs are READS. A growing set of nouns has WRITE verbs —
'beat' (add/update/move/delete), 'lesson' (create/update/move), 'video'
(create/move/update) and 'pitch' (create/update). Every other verb is read-only,
and each verb's own --help is authoritative about whether it reads or writes.

DOMAIN MODEL
  A Course is the primary entity. Its structure is snapshotted into Course
  Versions: a Draft Version (latest, editable) and zero or more Published
  Versions (frozen at Publish). Version-scoped reads default to the Draft.
  A Version contains Sections (directory-backed groupings), each containing
  Lessons. A Lesson contains Videos; a Video is an ordered sequence of Clips
  (recorded timeline) and is planned as an ordered sequence of Beats
  (intended structure, by job/kind). Pitches are course ideas with a derived
  Pitch State. Deliverables are calendar entries linking Courses and/or Pitches.

ADDRESSING (output is for agents)
  All 'get' arguments are IDs only. 'list' output is identity-rich (id, name/
  title, slug/path, parent ids) so you can map a name to an id in one call.
  Typical workflow: 'cvm <noun> list' to find an id, then 'cvm <noun> get <id>',
  or 'cvm <noun> tree <id>' then pipe to jq to drill in.

VERSIONS
  Version-scoped reads (course / section / lesson / tree) default to the Draft
  Version. Pass --course-version <id> to pin a Published Version snapshot.

ARCHIVED
  'list' shows ACTIVE records only. Only 'course' and standalone 'video' have a
  viewable archive (use --archived to include it). For every other noun,
  archived means deleted and is never shown.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
  Raw JSON, no envelope. 'get' of one id => one JSON object. 'list' and multi-id
  'get' => NDJSON (one compact object per line). Empty list => no output, exit 0.
  Errors => a JSON object on STDERR carrying the Effect error _tag. STDOUT is
  always pure data. Exit codes: 0 ok, 2 not-found, 3 invalid-input, 4 db/internal.

WRITES
  Write verbs hit the database immediately — no confirmation prompt, no dry-run —
  and each echoes the affected row as one pretty JSON object. Flags come BEFORE
  any positional <id> (a flag after it exits 3). The write surface:
    beat    add/update/move/delete   author a Video's Beat plan
                                     (add --pitch <id> targets a pitch's video)
    lesson  create/update/move       create a GHOST lesson, rename its title,
                                     or reorder / re-home it (DB↔disk in sync)
    video   create/move/update       create a Video, re-home it to a lesson/
                                     pitch, or rename it (--name)
    pitch   create/update            create a Pitch (--title required) or patch
                                     its copy/ranking fields
  See each noun's --help for the authoritative contract.

SEARCH
  search <query>   Case-insensitive substring search DOWN THE TREE across every
                   active course's Draft Version + all pitches (--type to narrow
                   result kinds). Scoped variants: 'cvm course|section|lesson
                   search <id> <query>' confine the walk to that subtree.`;
