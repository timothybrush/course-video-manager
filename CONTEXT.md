# Course Video Manager

A tool for authoring courses as structured collections of sections, lessons, and videos — held entirely in the database and published as immutable snapshots (`.mp4` files plus a `course.json`).

## Language

### Course structure

**Course**:
The primary domain entity: a structured collection of versions, sections, lessons, and videos, held entirely in the database. Not backed by any on-disk repository — the former git-repo backing was retired (ADR 0018).
_Avoid_: Repo, Project

**Section**:
A grouping of lessons within a course version, ordered by fractional index. Identity is carried by its `title` (uniqueness enforced per-parent by `order`); its display path is derived from title, not stored.
_Avoid_: Module, Unit

**Lesson**:
A single learning unit within a section. A pure database record — no on-disk folder. Identity is carried by its `title` (uniqueness per-parent by `order`).
_Avoid_: Exercise, Tutorial, Step

### Course versions

**CourseVersion**:
A snapshot of a course's section/lesson/video structure. Its lifecycle state is recorded explicitly (never inferred from position or naming): Draft Version → Pending Version → Published Version.
_Avoid_: Version (too vague), Revision

**Draft Version**:
The single mutable CourseVersion being edited — the only state accepting section/lesson/video/clip writes. Exactly one per course; no name or description.
_Avoid_: Current version, Working version

**Pending Version**:
A Submitted CourseVersion whose Dropbox commit receipt has not yet landed. Immutable, named, short-lived: either Promoted (receipt landed) or Discarded (commit failed). At most one per course; one found at rest means a crash between receipt and Promote.
_Avoid_: Frozen version (ambiguous with Published), In-flight version

**Published Version**:
An immutable CourseVersion with a name and description, created by Promoting a Pending Version; cannot be deleted.
_Avoid_: Released version, Committed version

**Submit**:
The Draft → Pending transition: stamps the publish name/description, marks the Draft Pending, and clones a fresh Draft. Refused while a Pending Version exists. In-flight writes serialize with it: each lands before the clone or is refused terminally — never stranded on the frozen version.
_Avoid_: Freeze (only half the story), Snapshot

**Promote**:
The Pending → Published transition, recorded once the Dropbox commit receipt (the atomic `course.json` rename) has landed.
_Avoid_: Finalize, Confirm

**Discard**:
Deletes a Pending Version whose commit did not land — never a Draft or Published one. Loses nothing: the Submitted content lives on in the Draft that Submit cloned. A caught commit failure auto-Discards (sync failures get one in-flight retry first; missing assets Discard immediately).
_Avoid_: Rollback, Delete version

**Publish**:
The release flow: Submit, then the Dropbox commit (upload culminating in the atomic `course.json` rename — the sole commit receipt), then Promote. Structure is derived from the database (never parsed from disk); the Dropbox output is exclusively `.mp4` files plus one `course.json` and its companion `course.schema.json` (referenced via `$schema`) — no authoring sidecars, no `changelog.md`. Every shipping **Video** must be complete — exportable **Clips** (hence an `.mp4` and an **Export Hash**), a `body`, and a `description` — so no `course.json` field is ever null; an incomplete Video fails the Publish (ADR 0019).
_Avoid_: Commit (that is one phase of it), Deploy, Push

**Export Version Key**:
A hardcoded constant in the codebase (`EXPORT_VERSION`) that, when bumped, invalidates all video export hashes and forces re-export.
_Avoid_: Version number, Build version

### Authoring lifecycle

**Lesson Authoring Status**:
A per-version marker on a **Lesson**: `todo` (default for new lessons) or `done` (set via the To-Do pill). Stored as `authoringStatus` and copied forward at Publish, so a Published Version's lessons keep their status at publish time. Every lesson has one (no ghost/real distinction). Distinct from **Pitch State**. Surfaced via the To-Do pill and the **Marked Ready** / **Marked TODO** changelog buckets.
_Avoid_: TODO flag, Completion

**Marked Ready** / **Marked TODO**:
The changelog buckets for **Lesson Authoring Status** transitions across **Published Versions** — `todo → done` and `done → todo` respectively. First-class per-section sections in the in-app changelog preview shown on the publish screen (the changelog is no longer written to disk).
_Avoid_: Completed, Reopened

### Video and clips

**Video**:
A container of clips and chapters that represents a single producible video output.
_Avoid_: Recording

**Standalone Video**:
A video with no lesson association (`lessonId = NULL`), used for reference or temporary content. A SEPARATE axis from **Video Format**: a Standalone video may be either **Landscape** or **Short**, and every **Short** is Standalone. Never use "Standalone" to mean a format.
_Avoid_: Orphan video, Unlinked video

**Video Format**:
An axis on every **Video** (the `video.format` column). One of two values: **Landscape** or **Short**. Defaults to Landscape.

**Landscape**:
A **Video** with `format: "landscape"`: a horizontal, long-form video. The default format. Shown in the app under `/videos`.
_Avoid_: Standard (the old value name)

**Short**:
A **Video** with `format: "short"`: a vertical, short-form video (the kind posted to YouTube Shorts / TikTok / etc.). Shown in the app under `/shorts`. "Short" is canonical everywhere.
_Avoid_: TikTok (reserved for the actual TikTok platform — the OBS recording profile and Buffer posting destinations — and NOT the canonical name for a Short)

**Clip**:
A timestamped segment of source footage within a video, defined by start/end times and a source filename.
_Avoid_: Segment, Cut, Take

**Effect Clip**:
A special clip for non-speech content (white noise, transitions) manually inserted into the timeline.
_Avoid_: Filler, Spacer

**Chapter**:
A named marker/divider within a video's timeline that visually groups related clips. Maps 1:1 to YouTube chapters.
_Avoid_: Clip group, Divider, Marker, Section (ambiguous with course Section)

**Video Post**:
A record of a **Video** posted to an external platform. Child of Video (cascade-deleted). Tracks platform, remote id/URL, `postedAt`.

**Optimistic Clip**:
A clip added to the frontend state during recording before it is persisted to the database.
_Avoid_: Pending clip, Temporary clip

**Clip Web Link**:
A web page on screen (focused Chrome window, `http(s)` page) while a **Clip** was recorded. One-to-many child of a Clip, captured live during the **Optimistic Clip** lifecycle by the link-capture Chrome extension (`chrome-extension/`) over the Stream Deck WebSocket hub; deduped per URL per Clip. Shown as chips under the Clip and annotated in the **Transcript** (`«on screen: …»`, first appearance only) so the writer agent knows which page accompanied each moment. Distinct from the global **Link** list: a Clip Web Link is positional and per-clip.
_Avoid_: Link (reserved for the global reference-URL list), Clip URL, On-screen link (informal, ok in prose)

**Transcript**:
The ordered text projection of a **Video** — its **Clips** and **Chapters** interleaved in timeline order. The unit of comparison for changelog diffs. Changes to either Clips or Chapters are first-class changes to the Transcript: a Chapter rename, insertion, deletion, or reorder is a Transcript change in the same sense that editing a Clip's text is. Rendered with each Chapter as a `## <name>` header between paragraphs of clip text.
_Avoid_: Clip text (only covers Clips), Joined clips, Caption (reserved for the per-clip transcription product)

**Video File**:
A plain file on disk attached to a **Video**, under `{VIDEO_FILES_DIR}/{lineageId}/` and addressed relative to it. Not a database row — the directory listing **is** the state; deleting is a real unlink (no `archived`, no restore). Belongs to the Video, never the Lesson; lesson-bound and **Standalone Videos** behave identically. Purpose: **writer context** — the Article Writer reads a Video's **Transcript**, **Beats**, and text Video Files, so this is how material never said on camera (code samples, notes) reaches the article. Extensions `ts/tsx/js/jsx/json/md/mdx/txt/csv` are ticked by default in the writer's picker; others start unticked; images pass as images. Subdirectories allowed; dotfiles and `node_modules` ignored. Managed from the editor UI or `cvm file`.
_Avoid_: Attachment, Asset (reserved for exported/published artifacts), Standalone file / Lesson file (the old UI-era split, now one concept)

### Video planning

**Beat**:
A single film-time planning unit of a **Video**, classified by its **job** for the viewer (the screenwriting sense of _beat_). A Video's plan is an ordered sequence of Beats authored _before_ recording. First-class entity belonging to the **Video** (not Lesson or Pitch): duplicating a Video copies its Beats, and a Beat can be dragged between Videos (Videos themselves sort alphabetically, never reordered). Deliberately **distinct from a Chapter** (the recorded-timeline grouping of **Clips**): a Beat is the _intended_ structure — "what I planned to shoot" vs "what I shot". Five kinds from the Mise en Place glossary: **Definition**, **Walkthrough**, **Playthrough**, **Quest**, **Reaction**.
_Avoid_: Chapter (the recorded YouTube grouping), Segment (now only the transcript/silence homonym), Section (course Section), Block, Unit

**Beat Description**:
A free-text planning note on a **Beat** — "what I'm actually going to do or say here" — distinct from its short **title**. Plain text, edited inline (auto-growing textarea). A purely in-app authoring aid: like the Beat itself, it is never published (Publish skips it). Surfaced and editable on the **Section Workbench** and on the editor's **Beats tab** (the current video's plan, read while recording); deliberately **hidden on the course view**, which is already information-dense.
_Avoid_: Notes, Summary, Body, Caption

**Section Workbench**:
A drill-down authoring surface for one **Section** (`/courses/:courseId/sections/:sectionId`), reached from the course view via a Section header (top) or Lesson title (deep link). An expanded reskin of the compact course view: shows each Lesson's **Videos** and **Beats** with **Beat Descriptions** inline-editable. Its added value is that beat/description layer; structural editing is inherited from the reused course-view components. Sibling sections are not shown — go back through the course view.
_Avoid_: Section page, Lesson page (the workbench is section-altitude; there is no lesson-altitude page), Section editor

### Video warnings

**Video Warning**:
A derived, non-blocking authoring problem surfaced on a **Video** in the UI. Computed live from the video's clips and chapters — never stored. Each warning has a stable kind (e.g. `missingOpeningChapter`). Generalizes the existing per-clip "danger" signal (Levenshtein text similarity) to the video level so course-tree views can flag videos at a glance.
_Avoid_: Lint warning, Lint error, Danger (reserved for the per-clip text-similarity signal until it is renamed to a Video Warning kind), Authoring issue

**Missing Opening Chapter**:
The Video Warning kind raised when a **Video** has at least one **Clip** but no **Chapter** positioned before its first clip in timeline order. Models the YouTube convention that every published video opens with a named chapter. Videos with zero clips do not raise this warning.
_Avoid_: No intro chapter, Missing 0:00 chapter

### Video export and hashing

**Export Hash**:
A SHA256 hash derived from a video's clip filenames, timestamps, clip order, and the Export Version Key; determines whether a video needs re-export.
_Avoid_: Content hash, Video hash

**Exported Video**:
A rendered `.mp4` file on disk named `{courseId}-{exportHash}.mp4` in the finished videos directory.
_Avoid_: Finished video, Output video

**Unexported Video**:
A video whose current Export Hash does not match any file on disk; blocks publishing.
_Avoid_: Dirty video, Stale video

**Purge**:
The deliberate deletion of an Exported Video's `.mp4` file from disk, transitioning it back to an Unexported Video; reversible via re-export.
_Avoid_: Clear, Delete from file system, Unexport

### Recording

**Recording Session**:
A time-bounded window during which clips are captured via OBS, grouping optimistic clips before persistence.
_Avoid_: Session, Take session

**Silence Length**:
A per-Recording-Session setting (`short` or `long`) for how long a silence must last to end a clip: `short` (default) cuts on brief mid-sentence pauses, `long` only on extended ones. Locked at recording start; applied symmetrically to the frontend speech detector and backend FFmpeg silence detection.
_Avoid_: Pause Length (former name — reused "Pause", now the clip-level held pause), Silence mode, Silence sensitivity, Pause threshold

**Pause**:
A clip-level marker (`none`/`long`) that inserts a short held pause after a **Clip** in the edit — `long` holds ~0.18s, `none` is an ordinary clip. Toggled per clip, shown as an ellipsis ("…"). An enum, not a boolean, so it can gain more lengths later. Distinct from **Silence Length** (the recording cut threshold).
_Avoid_: Beat (former `beatType`), Silence Length, Gap, Hold

**Insertion Point**:
The position in a video timeline where new clips or chapters will be added (start, after-clip, after-chapter, end).
_Avoid_: Cursor, Drop target

**Transcription**:
The process of populating a clip's `text` field from its audio, tracked by `transcribedAt`.
_Avoid_: Caption, Subtitle

### Pitches

**Pitch**:
A reusable packaging artifact — the YouTube/newsletter/tweet copy and thumbnail concept for a video idea — authored _before_ the video itself is recorded. A Pitch is independent of the Course hierarchy; it relates only to **Standalone Videos**.
_Avoid_: Idea, Concept, Draft (overloaded with Draft Version)

**Pitch State**:
A Pitch's state, derived (never stored) from its linked **Deliverables'** **Deliverable Status**: **Idle** (none linked), **Scheduled** (some linked, not all terminal), **Shipped** (all terminal — `done`/`cancelled`). Abandonment is separate: a Pitch is hidden by **Archive**, not Pitch State.
_Avoid_: Pitch Status (no stored status field), Desk State, Pipeline state

**Effort**:
A manual planning estimate on a **Pitch** of the eventual video's production work: `low` (1), `medium` (2, default), `high` (3), stored as an integer mirroring **Priority**. Lives on the Pitch because it is a triage input used _before_ the video exists. Within a priority band, low-effort sorts first ("low-hanging fruit"); effort never overrides priority across bands.
_Avoid_: Estimate, Cost, Size, Complexity

**Default Pitch Filter**:
The pitches index defaults to **Idle + Scheduled**; a reveal toggle brings **Shipped** into view. At the default the filter URL param is omitted, so `/pitches` bookmarks survive default changes.

### Reference video

**Reference Video**:
Another **Video** on the same **Lesson**, opened alongside the one being recorded so the author can read its **Clip** transcripts (grouped by **Chapter**) while re-recording. No FK — the candidate set is "other non-archived Videos on this Lesson". Opt-in per editor session via the actions menu ("Add Reference"); the panel never auto-selects. With no eligible siblings the action is unavailable.
_Avoid_: Previous Take (implies take-history we don't model), Reference Take, Source Video

### Diagrams

**Diagram**:
A named, persistent identity in the diagrams sidebar — the "home" for a series of snapshots that evolve across the **Clips** it appears in. Conceptually a lineage, surfaced in the UI as a single item. Independent of the Course hierarchy; a Diagram can be referenced from Clips in any **Video** (lesson-bound or **Standalone Video**).
_Avoid_: Drawing, Sketch, Canvas, Scene (Scene is TLDraw's term for its scene JSON — reserved for that)

**DiagramSnapshot**:
An immutable capture of a Diagram's TLDraw scene at the moment a specific **Clip** was filmed. Pinned to a Clip so that returning to that Clip later surfaces the diagram state it was filmed against, even after the Diagram has been edited for subsequent clips.
_Avoid_: Frame, Revision, Checkpoint, Version (overloaded with **CourseVersion**)

**Active Diagram**:
The Diagram currently loaded into the playground's TLDraw canvas. May be `null` — in which case the playground is on its **Playground Home** screen instead. Set by picking a Diagram on Playground Home or by the "New Diagram" action (loads `headScene` into the canvas); persists across **Clips** until changed.
_Avoid_: Current diagram, Open diagram

**Playground Home**:
The diagram-less mode of the Diagram Playground popup: a full-window picker/grid for browsing existing Diagrams and creating new ones. The popup is in this mode if there is no **Active Diagram**. Distinct from the active canvas mode; switching between the two is an in-popup navigation, not a window-open event.
_Avoid_: Diagram picker, Diagrams page (overloaded with the deprecated parent route)

**Preserved Snapshot**:
A **DiagramSnapshot** flagged to stay visible in its Diagram's timeline even with no non-archived **Clip** pinning it. Created via "Preserve snapshot" (forks `headScene` into a Clip-independent snapshot) or silently auto-created when **Restore to Head** would overwrite an unpreserved head. Non-preserved snapshots vanish when all pinning Clips are archived; Preserved ones don't. Preserved and pinned are independent reasons to keep a snapshot visible. Shown as a pill on the timeline thumbnail.
_Avoid_: Manual snapshot, Saved snapshot, Standalone snapshot, Bookmark

**Restore to Head**:
Loading an older **DiagramSnapshot**'s scene back into the Active Diagram's `headScene`, replacing the live canvas. When triggered from a search-result click, the outgoing head is silently auto-preserved first (no dialog; see **Preserved Snapshot**). When triggered from the timeline's Restore button, the existing `RestoreSnapshotDialog` confirms the action. No-op when the head already matches the target snapshot.
_Avoid_: Revert, Roll back, Undo

### Video destinations

**Skills Changelog**:
A published AI Hero entity bundling an article and a Kit newsletter draft for one **Video**. Created via `POST /api/skills/changelog`; publishes immediately and triggers Inngest `skill-changelog/published`, which creates a Kit newsletter draft (template `5176054`, from `matt@aihero.dev`) — drafts only, never sends. Newsletter required; article + newsletter authored on one page. Public at `https://www.aihero.dev/skills/<slug>`, with a footer linking back.
_Avoid_: Changelog (ambiguous with course publish changelog), Skill post, Changelog entry

### Deliverables and scheduling

**Deliverable**:
A manually-authored entry on the **Deliverables Calendar**, pinned to a single all-day date. May link to zero or more **Courses** and/or **Pitches**; the Deliverable's own state is never derived, but a linked Pitch's **Pitch State** is derived from it. Archived Deliverables are hidden from both the active calendar and the history disclosure — archive is the only hide.
_Avoid_: Task, Item, Scheduled work, Ship target

**Deliverable Status**:
A manual marker on a **Deliverable**: `planned` (default), `done`, or `cancelled`. All transitions reversible; never derived from linked entities. Distinct from **Archive** — `cancelled` Deliverables stay on the calendar; archiving is what hides them.
_Avoid_: Completion, Deliverable state

**Deliverables Calendar**:
The in-app view of all **Deliverables** across past and future dates, used for both forward planning and inventory.
_Avoid_: Delivery calendar, Schedule, Roadmap, Content calendar

**ISO Week**:
ISO 8601 week numbering (weeks start Monday; week 1 contains the year's first Thursday). Surfaces as `Week N` in the agenda header.
_Avoid_: Calendar week, Week number (without "ISO" qualifier)

### Ordering and lifecycle

**Fractional Index**:
A string-based ordering value that allows inserting items between existing items without reindexing siblings.
_Avoid_: Sort order, Position

**Archive**:
Soft-deletion: hiding an entity from active views while retaining it in the database.
_Avoid_: Delete, Remove

**ARCHIVE Section**:
A special section directory whose name ends in `ARCHIVE`, filtered out of the default course view.

### Dependencies

**Lesson Dependency**:
A directed edge from one **Lesson** to an earlier one it builds on, stored as a list of lesson IDs on `lesson.dependencies`. Conceptually points backward (a lesson depends on prerequisites above it); a dependency on a _later_ lesson is an **Order Violation**, warned-about but not blocked. Cycles are blocked at creation.
_Avoid_: Prerequisite link, Edge (unqualified)

**Order Violation**:
A persisted state where a **Lesson** depends on another lesson ordered _after_ it (within a section, or in a later section). Surfaced as a non-blocking warning on reorder and as a per-lesson indicator; never prevented, so violations can exist in saved state.
_Avoid_: Broken dependency, Invalid order

**Dependency Group**:
A maximal run of _contiguous_ lessons within one **Section**, in display order, chained by **Lesson Dependencies**: walking top-to-bottom, a lesson joins the group iff it directly depends on a lesson already in it. Purely within-section, contiguous, directed-backward — gap-spanning or forward (**Order Violation**) dependencies are not represented. Shown as dashed lines between adjacent lesson icons (a group of one shows none); suppressed while a search/filter is active. Read-only visual grouping, distinct from **Section**.
_Avoid_: Dependency block, Cluster, Chain, Lesson group
