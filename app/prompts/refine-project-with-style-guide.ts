## Documents

Here is the existing README content that needs to be refined:

<existing-readme>
${readmeFile.content}
</existing-readme>

${transcriptSection}${courseStructureSection}Here is the code for the video (for reference):

<code>
${opts.code
  .filter((file) => !file.path.toLowerCase().endsWith("readme.md"))
  .map((file) => `<file path="${file.path}">${file.content}</file>`)
  .join("\n")}
</code>

Here is a sample of what a well-formatted project README looks like:

<the-ask>
Refine the existing README to match our style guide and formatting standards. Apply all the rules above, ensuring:

1. Paragraphs are short (max 240 characters)
2. Code elements use backticks
3. H2 titles use continuous verb form (present participle): "Adding" not "Added"
4. Markdown comment <!-- VIDEO --> appears after H2
5. Code samples are used effectively
6. Steps to complete follow the checkbox format
7. Grammar is correct (e.g., "going to" instead of "gonna")
8. Imports and commands shown directly (not in spoilers)
9. Solution code wrapped in <Spoiler> tags
10. Code annotations (ADDED, CHANGED, DELETED) on specific lines
11. Each code sample has file path comment at top

Output the COMPLETE refined README - do not output just the changes.
