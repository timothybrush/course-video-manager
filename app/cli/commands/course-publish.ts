 * NAME CONTRACT
 *   The version name MUST be a lowercase-'v' prefixed semver — `v1.2.3`,
 *   optionally with a `-prerelease` and/or `+build` suffix. We validate the

const PUBLISH_HELP = `Publish a Course: mirror its Draft Version to Dropbox, then freeze it as a
named Published Version.

Publish is the atomic release operation (see CONTEXT.md). It (1) validates the
shippable output, (2) copies every shipping Video's .mp4 plus a course.json and
a content-addressed asset bundle plus root course.json into Dropbox, (3) freezes
the Draft Version by stamping it with --name and --description, and (4) clones a
fresh empty Draft to carry on editing. The published snapshot is immutable and
can never be deleted.

ADDRESSING
  The positional argument is the COURSE id (find it via 'cvm course list'). The
  Draft Version (the course's latest) is what gets published — you do not pass a
  version id.

VERSION NAME (--name, required)
  Must be a lowercase-'v' prefixed SemVer: v<major>.<minor>.<patch>, optionally
  with a -prerelease and/or +build suffix. Examples: v1.0.0, v2.3.1,
  v1.0.0-beta.2. A malformed name, or one already used by a Published Version of
  this course, is rejected (exit 3) before anything is written.

VALIDATION
  Every shipping Video must already be exported (have its .mp4) and the course
  view must be lint-clean for the effective output. If not, the publish is
  refused with a PublishValidationError listing the offending video ids — nothing
  is uploaded and no version is frozen. Export the missing videos first, then
  re-run. If Dropbox fails after the database freeze, the command returns
  DropboxCommitPendingError with both version ids and the original to-do policy.
  The Published Version and new Draft remain safe, and the frozen-version Dropbox
  sync can retry that exact version without deleting either one.

FLAGS
  --name <vX.Y.Z>     (required) the Published Version name.
  --description <text> (required) description for the Published Version.
  --exclude-todo      withhold to-do Lessons (default ships every Lesson, matching
                      the standalone Dropbox mirror).

OUTPUT
  One pretty JSON object: { publishedVersionId, newDraftVersionId, name,
  description }. Errors go to STDERR as the usual tagged contract object.

EXAMPLES
  cvm course publish course_123 --name v1.0.0 --description "first cut"
  cvm course publish course_123 --name v1.1.0 --description "adds the testing section"
  cvm course publish course_123 --name v2.0.0-beta.1 --description "beta" --exclude-todo`;
